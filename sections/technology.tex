\section{Software Technology Stack}
\label{sec:technology}

\textcolor{red}{Introduce in (sufficient) depth the key concepts and architecture of the chosen software technologies. As part if this, you may consider using a running example to introduce the technology.}

\textcolor{red}{Emphasize the “new” software technologies that was selected by the group and which has not been covered in the course.}

\textcolor{red}{This part and other parts of the report probably needs to refer to
figures. Figure~\ref{fig:framework} from \cite{brown:96} just
illustrates how figure can be included in the report.}

\subsection{Angular:}
We chose Angular as our web application framework to develop the frontend of the FeedApp
prototype. Angular is a popular, open source TypeScript based framework that is used to create
Single Page Applications (SPAs). SPAs are web applications that only loads one single page, and then
changes the content of that page depending on how the user interacts with the page.

Fundamental Consepts of Angular: 
\begin{description}
\item[Components]: components are many places described as the main building blocks for Angular applications. Each
component will contain one HTML-file with the UI-template of the component and one TypeScript-
file that contains the components logic. It can also contain CSS or SCSS files, defining the styles of the
component, as well as test files and configuration files. A component defines a specific view, as well
as the functionality that goes into that view. In other words, it contains both what the user sees in
the UI and the logic that goes into the component.
\item[Services]:It is also possible to share different functions and logic between different components. This
can be done by creating a service, which is a TypeScript file that is used for tasks such as for example
business logic and handling of data. In our FeedApp implementation, we created services dedicated to managing authentication and handling poll data.
\item[Dependency Injection (DI)]: Services can also be used to inject dependencies into multiple
components, with the use of DI. This is useful for connecting the different parts of the application.
\item[Routing]: The Angular Router handles the navigation between different views as users performs different tasks. This is a key element in SPAs since instead of reloading the page every time the view is changed, 

One of the main advantages of creating the application as a SPA is that it speeds up the development
process.

\subsection{Spring Boot}
\label{subsec:springboot}
We have chosen Spring Boot as our enterprice software framework when developing our application. Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the development process, making it possible to create a functioning web application fast. To fully understand the benefits of the Spring Boot extension, we are first going to talk a little bit about some of Springs main consepts.  

\textbf{Spring Configurations Explained:}
\begin{description}
    \item[Bean Definitions]: In Spring, objects managed by the Spring Inversion of Control (IoC) container are referred to as beans. Configurations involve specifying these beans and managing their lifecycle within the application.
    \item[Dependency Injection (DI)]: Spring's DI mechanism manages dependencies among application components. This setup is crucial for injecting required services or modules into different parts of the application.
    \item[Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)]: Configurations in Spring also include setting up aspects for handling cross-cutting concerns like logging or transaction management.
    \item[Data Source and Transaction Management]: For applications interacting with databases, configurations encompass setting up database connections and managing transactions effectively.
\end{description}

\textbf{Deploying a Spring Application:}
\begin{description}
    \item[Packaging]: The application is compiled and packaged, typically into a JAR or WAR file, ready for deployment.
    \item[Running on a Server]: The packaged application is deployed on a web server. Spring Boot, with its embedded server capability, simplifies this by allowing the application to run independently without needing a separate server setup.
\end{description}

\textbf{Spring Boot's Role in FeedApp:}
\begin{description}
    \item[Auto-Configuration]: Spring Boot automatically configures the application based on the included libraries, reducing the need for extensive manual configuration.
    \item[Simplified Deployment]: The embedded server feature of Spring Boot allows our application to be deployed as a standalone unit, enhancing ease of deployment and portability.
\end{description}

In the implementation of our FeedApp prototype, the use of SpringBoots autoconfiguration and deployment functionalities has meade it possible for us to spend more time on the applications buissness logic.
